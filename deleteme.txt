Hey Jeremy! Didn't get a chance yesterday to catch up...! I start at DemoChimp today. I wanted to thank you again for everything. I will keep in touch, and have told the students that they can reach me over slack and that they can contact me at any time. My group is very solid. They have required very little mentor help so far. Hopefully I can get away so I can attend demo-day Friday next week. 
Oh! When I finish polishing my 'tooncodes' (the comics on coding topics) I will send you the material so it can be posted in the resources website. It's been a little slow getting them out, I know!
Now that I am not linked to DevMountain as a worker, let me know if there is anything to help I might do, in the way of blog posts, reviews, surveys etc.
